## 🎥 RECORDING DEMO TIPS

**During Recording (15 seconds):**
1. [0:00-0:03] Make FIST (red fireworks)
2. [0:03-0:06] Transition to PINCH (purple saturn)
3. [0:06-0:09] Transition to OPEN (cyan heart)
4. [0:09-0:12] Slow swipe left (cycle shape)
5. [0:12-0:15] Return to FIST with flourish

**Making It Impressive:**
- Move hand slowly for smooth color transitions
- Make full-hand gestures (clear transitions)
- Move hand across screen (shows tracking)
- Vary speed (shows responsiveness)
- End strong (confident final gesture)
