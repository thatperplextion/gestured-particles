```javascript
// User makes FIST → Audio plays low rumble
// User makes OPEN → Audio plays high beep
// User makes PINCH → Audio plays mid-tone
// User SWIPES → Audio plays whoosh effect

// All controlled via Web Audio API
// Volume: 0-50% adjustable
// Latency: <10ms
```

**Presentation Value:** 
- Adds sensory engagement
- Proves real-time responsiveness
- Makes gestures feel tangible
- Impressive technology demo

### ⚙️ #2: Real-Time Settings Panel
**What It Does:** Control everything without reloading

```javascript
Settings Available:
✓ Particle Count (500-5000)
✓ Gesture Sensitivity (0.5x-1.5x)
✓ Particle Trails (enable/length)
✓ Audio Feedback (enable/volume)
✓ Motion Mode (pulse/orbit/swirl)
✓ Smoothing Factor (0.05-0.4)
✓ Particle Size (0.02-0.1)
✓ Theme (dark/light)

User performs gestures (15-30 sec)
    ↓
User clicks ⏹ Stop
    ↓
WebM video auto-downloaded
    ↓
Can play on projector/share
```

**Capabilities:**
